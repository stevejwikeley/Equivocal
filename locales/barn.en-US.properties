room-name=Manoir B&B
short-description=A traditional very spacious double bedroom with great views on the country side; private bathroom. Arrangement possible up to 5 persons. 
long-description=At the top of the hill in the hamlet of Moux sits a distinguished manor house in pink tinted stone from the fifteenth century. It was the property of the Salins family, founders of the Hospices de Beaune. Whilst the Manor’s simple style is in keeping with its peaceful backdrop, it has been restored with fine craftsmanship and skill. The soft rich colours which make up the interiors are in themselves conductive to a sense of calm. The elegant house calls to mind the patrician life of past days. A huge farmyard barn, majestic stone walls, a dovecote and rows of crops in the fields around - the panorama swings from the Mont Blanc to the western sun and the golden vineyards right in the heart of Burgundy. After a long dormant period, Equivocal and its thick and welcoming walls offers you hospitality where silence and nature reign supreme. This reawakened heritage building invites you to throw open wide its grand windows to the enlivening air, the forest sounds and gentle murmur of the nearby rivers. The manor’s spacious guest room with medieval lines, regal fireplace guarantees relaxation and true comfort. The village enjoys an ideal location surrounded by some of the finest wine estates of the region, only 12km from Beaune and 8km from Nuits-Saint-Georges. Delicious breakfast included. This is a dream domain to bask in for a countryside interlude.
