room-name=The Dovecote
short-description=Beautifully secluded B&B in a 15th century bird tower
long-description=The 15th century cylindric dovecote topped with a  coned roof, holds a dominant and stragetic position due to its former role as a watchtower. It lies at the junction between the manor and the barn. Its round stone walls are filled with over a thousand interior niches. From the den all the way up to the bedroom, certain niches penetrate completely through the walls offering stunning micro views to the surrounding fields and forests. These piercings also create stunning rays of light that move and drift throughout the interior. The bedroom is capped by the ancient dovecotes rafters visible through the transparent ceiling. This addition of a transparent ceiling ensures guests safety from any nocturnal owl intrusions.
